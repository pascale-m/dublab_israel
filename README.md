UI Design for Dublab Israel website.

This was my first paid UI project.

Please note that the PDF rendering represented here is flawed. The blue border of the desktop view should be one simple line on each side.

Was published at https://projects.dublab.com/tradition&transition/ .

Current site at URL was redesigned to fit better with dublab's main website.
